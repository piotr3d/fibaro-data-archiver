# fibaro-data-archiver

This is a simple script that retrieves and stores data from Fibaro HC2 (Z-wave controller). Due to the limited storage Fibaro purges old data and I wanted to keep them longer. In my case event data was lost after 7-8 days which was the main reason to come up with a way to archive it.
